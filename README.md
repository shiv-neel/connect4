# connect4 AI


This script runs a connect4 simulator in which the user and computer take turns placing coins into slots until 
either player connects 4 coins in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Computer uses a recursive minimax
algorithm, using a binary tree and alpha-beta pruning to select the move that will yield the best possible advantage
up to 5 moves ahead.
